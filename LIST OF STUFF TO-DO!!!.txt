 - figure out how to do f key bindings and client zoom saving
 - pest control portals, should have more hp and monsters should not drop items
 - torcher npc death anims
 - rewards shop is buggy, the exp things say not enough points .-.

      5$ each, give like really good random gears

 - dragon thrownaxes projectile incorrect
 - make resource supply crates and consumption (pots, foods) supply crates for donator store
